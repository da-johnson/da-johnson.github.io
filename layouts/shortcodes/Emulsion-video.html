        Visualization of GUV formation via the inverted emulsion method. Emulsion droplets, each containing an aqueous core, are centrifuged through the oil–water interface. As they cross this boundary, a lipid bilayer forms around each droplet, finally the GUVs collect in a pellet at the bottom of the container.
